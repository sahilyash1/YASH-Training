The relationships:-

Generalization- 
Generalization is the process of extracting common properties from a set of entities and create a generalized entity from it. 
It is a bottom-up approach.
Example-  Here Student and Faculty can be generalized to a higher level entity called User.

Specialization-
In specialization, an entity is divided into sub-entities based on their characteristics. It is a top-down approach 
Example- Here Student entity  can be specialized into Graduate and PostGraduate type entities.

Composition- implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. 
Example: Student (parent) and Graduate (child). Graduate class don't exist if Student class is removed.

Aggregation- In aggregation, the relation between two entities is treated as a single entity. In aggregation, relationship with its corresponding entities is aggregated into a higher level entity.
Example: Department entity offers the Course entity, it acts as a single entity in the relationship which is in a relationship with another entity Student.
